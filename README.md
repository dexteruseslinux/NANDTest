# NANDTest
A small Godmode9 script to test your 3DS NAND by backing up said NAND 5 times.
# Instructions
**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 6GB OF SPACE AVAILABLE ON YOUR SD/MICROSD!**
Copy script to gm9/scripts on your 3DS SD/microSD card.
Press the HOME Button in Godmode9, then select Scripts, and then NANDTest.
Press A to start it.
After you're done backing up those, compare the SHA256 files against eachother. If they're all the same, your NAND is good!
If they're different, then your NAND may be dying.

# How to contribute code to this project
The code MUST be related to NAND testing!
Anyway, just ask me on Discord (dexteruseslinux#8570) to add it, I'll credit you too in the Credits.
